    In this course we will learn everything you need to know to be able to write Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, from
    scratch. We will learn how to create and attach CSS stylesheets to our HTML files so that they affect our HTML, basic
    CSS syntax, and some common properties that will allow us to change the color of text, manipulate the width of images,
    add borders, and change the background color of web pages. We will also learn important concepts like how to keep our
    files organized by using comments and grouping selectors, understanding the cascade, and validating our code to check
    for common errors. Software required: Brackets Text Editor, Google Chrome Browser.In this course we will learn everything you need to know to be able to write Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, from
